# Advanced JavaScript Crash Course

In today's crash course on advanced JavaScript concepts, we delved into several important topics that will deepen your understanding of the language. Below, we'll explore each concept in detail:

## Scope in JavaScript: Nested Function Scope

Scope in JavaScript refers to the context in which variables and functions are accessible. A nested function scope occurs when a function is defined within another function. The inner function has access to its own scope as well as the scope of its containing (outer) function. This allows for encapsulation and helps prevent variable conflicts.

## Closure: Combination of Function Definition and Its Scope

Closures are a powerful concept in JavaScript. A closure is formed when a nested function "closes over" its containing function's scope, retaining access to the variables and parameters of that outer function even after the outer function has finished executing. This enables data encapsulation and the creation of private variables.

## JavaScript Currying: Functional Composition via Nested Functions

JavaScript currying is a technique for creating functions with multiple arguments by breaking down the function into a series of nested functions, each accepting one argument. These nested functions eventually lead to the final function call that processes all the collected arguments. Currying is based on the concept of closures and allows for a more flexible and compositional way of working with functions.

## The "this" Keyword: Different Bindings

The `this` keyword in JavaScript refers to the context in which a function is executed. There are several binding rules:

1. **Implicit Binding**: `this` refers to the object to the left of the dot when a function is called.

2. **Explicit Binding**: The `call`, `apply`, or `bind` methods are used to explicitly bind `this` to a specific object.

3. **New Binding**: When a constructor function is used to create an instance of an object, `this` refers to the newly created instance.

4. **Default Binding**: If none of the above rules apply, `this` refers to the global object (in non-strict mode) or `undefined` (in strict mode).

## Prototype and Prototypal Inheritance

In JavaScript, objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects via their prototypes. Each object has a prototype object, and properties/methods defined in the prototype are accessible to instances of that object. This mechanism is known as prototypal inheritance, and it forms the basis of object-oriented programming in JavaScript.

## Class Inheritance

ES6 introduced the concept of classes in JavaScript, providing a more familiar syntax for implementing inheritance. Classes allow you to create blueprints for objects, defining their properties and methods. Subclasses can inherit from parent classes, enabling a hierarchical structure of shared and specialized functionality.

This concludes our overview of today's advanced JavaScript crash course. These concepts are fundamental to becoming a proficient JavaScript developer, and practicing them will greatly enhance your ability to create efficient and well-structured code. Keep exploring and experimenting to solidify your understanding!
