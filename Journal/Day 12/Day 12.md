Explanation of Tools Used in the Code
Express
Express is a fast, unopinionated, and minimalist web framework for Node.js. It provides a set of features and utilities for building web applications and APIs. Express simplifies tasks like routing, handling requests and responses, middleware management, and more. In this code, Express is used to create a web server, handle routes, and manage HTTP requests and responses.

Usage in Large-Scale Projects: Express is widely used in large-scale projects to create scalable and modular web applications. Its flexibility allows developers to structure their applications according to their needs. It's suitable for building APIs, web applications, and microservices.
Node.js fs Module
The fs module in Node.js provides functions to interact with the file system. It allows you to read from and write to files on the server's file system.

Usage in Large-Scale Projects: The fs module is commonly used in large-scale projects for various file-related operations such as reading configuration files, logging data, storing user uploads, and managing data persistence. However, in a large-scale project, it's important to consider asynchronous operations and error handling to ensure smooth and reliable file operations.
JSON.parse and JSON.stringify
JSON.parse is a built-in JavaScript function that parses a JSON string and converts it into a JavaScript object. JSON.stringify is another built-in function that converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string.

Usage in Large-Scale Projects: These functions are essential for handling data in JSON format, which is commonly used for communication between clients and servers, data storage, and configuration files in large-scale projects. They ensure consistent data interchange and storage.
Middleware in Express
In the code, the Express middleware is used to handle incoming JSON data (express.json()) and to serve static assets. Middleware functions are functions that execute sequentially before the final request handler is called. They can modify the request and response objects, perform authentication, logging, and more.

Usage in Large-Scale Projects: Middleware is crucial in large-scale projects to implement cross-cutting concerns like authentication, authorization, request validation, and logging. It helps maintain a clean and organized codebase by separating concerns and enabling reusability.
