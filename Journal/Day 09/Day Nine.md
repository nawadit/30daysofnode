**Title: Introduction to Command Line Interface (CLI) Development**

**Definition and Examples:**
- A CLI stands for Command Line Interface, a text-based user interface for interacting with computer programs using command lines.
- Examples of popular CLI tools include npm and git.

**Objectives:**
1. **Creating a Basic CLI Tool using Node and npm:**
   - Develop a simple Command Line Interface tool using Node.js and npm.
   
2. **Passing Options to the CLI:**
   - Learn how to pass options and arguments to the CLI tool.
   - Utilize the `process.argv` array to access command line arguments, with options starting from index 2.
   - Introduce the `yargs` package for more convenient option handling.
   - Illustrate usage of `yargs` to extract options using code like:
     ```javascript
     const yargs = require("yargs");
     const { argv } = yargs(process.argv);
     ```
   
3. **Adding Interactivity:**
   - Enhance the CLI tool's interactivity by prompting users for input.
   - Use the `inquirer` package (version 8.2.5) to facilitate user prompts.
   - Demonstrate the creation of prompts using code such as:
     ```javascript
     const inquirer = require("inquirer");
     const prompt = inquirer.createPromptModule();
     
     prompt([{
       type: "input",
       name: "pokemon",
       message: "Enter a Pokemon name to view its 5 moves:"
     }]).then((res) => {
       // Process user input and perform relevant actions
     });
     ```

**Creating a Basic CLI:**
- A CLI tool is developed similar to creating an npm package.
- A hashbang (`#!/usr/bin/env node`) at the top of the script informs the interpreter to use Node.
- The `"bin"` field in `package.json` specifies the entry point to the CLI tool.
- After defining the bin property:
  - Install the package globally using `npm install -g`.
  - Access the CLI tool using the specified command (e.g., `npm command`).

**Conclusion:**
In summary, a Command Line Interface (CLI) serves as a text-based means to interact with software programs. This note covered the creation of a basic CLI tool using Node.js and npm, passing options to the CLI, and enhancing interactivity through user prompts using the `inquirer` package. CLI tools are valuable for automating tasks and enabling efficient interactions with software via terminal commands.
