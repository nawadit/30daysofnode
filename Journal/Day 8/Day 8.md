# Day 8: Exploring Node.js Internals and Introduction to Express

## 1. HTTP Routing and Web Frameworks
- Understanding the concept of HTTP routing and how it helps in handling different URLs and routes in a web application.
- Introduction to Express, a popular web application framework for Node.js.
- Express routing and its ability to manage different HTTP methods and route paths.

## 2. Node.js Runtime Recap
- Briefly revisiting the core concepts of the Node.js runtime environment.
- The event-driven, non-blocking I/O architecture of Node.js.
- Node.js single-threaded nature and the utilization of asynchronous callbacks for non-blocking operations.

## 3. Internals of Node.js
- Delving into the internal architecture of Node.js.
- Understanding the event loop and how it handles asynchronous tasks.
- JavaScript's single-threaded nature and the use of C/C++ bindings for certain operations.

## 4. JavaScript Library and C/C++ Features
- Node.js's ability to use JavaScript libraries and C/C++ features.
- Focusing on libuv, a C library responsible for handling asynchronous I/O operations.
- How libuv enhances Node.js's performance by managing I/O and event loop.

## 5. Introduction to libuv
- What is libuv and why it's crucial for Node.js's functioning.
- Exploring libuv's role in providing cross-platform asynchronous I/O operations.
- How libuv abstracts OS-specific details for better portability.

## 6. Thread Pool and Event Loop
- Understanding the concept of a thread pool and how it works in Node.js.
- The event loop's role in managing asynchronous operations efficiently.
- How threads from the thread pool handle I/O tasks in the background.

## 7. Changing Number of Threads in Thread Pool
- Exploring how to configure the number of threads in libuv's thread pool.
- Impact of thread pool size on performance and concurrency.
- Considering system resources and application requirements when adjusting thread pool size.

## 8. Network I/O and Queues
- Discussing the importance of efficient network I/O operations in Node.js.
- Introduction to different queues within the event loop: micro-tasks, timer queue, I/O queue, check queue, and close queue.
- How these queues work together to manage different types of asynchronous tasks.

## 9. Introduction to npm (Node Package Manager)
- Learning about npm and its role in managing Node.js packages.
- Overview of package.json, a configuration file that describes the project and its dependencies.
- Creating a package.json using the command `npm init --yes`.

## 10. Installing, Using, and Uninstalling Packages
- How to install packages using the `npm install` command.
- Importing and using installed packages in your Node.js applications.
- Uninstalling packages using the `npm uninstall` command.

## 11. Dependencies in package.json and Versioning
- Understanding the concept of dependencies and how they're managed in package.json.
- Introduction to semantic versioning (semver) and its role in specifying package versions.
- Different versioning schemes and their implications for compatibility.

## 12. Global Packages and Scripts
- Exploring the difference between global and local packages.
- Using global packages for command-line tools.
- Defining scripts in package.json to automate common tasks.

## 13. Publishing a Package on npm
- Overview of publishing your own package on the npm registry.
- Steps to create a public npm package and make it available for others to use.
- Best practices for writing package documentation and maintaining version history.
